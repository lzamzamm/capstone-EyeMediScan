## Reference dataset:

-   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunavenkatdoddi/eye-diseases-classification
-   https://www.kaggle.com/code/texasdave/classifying-eye-disease-in-ocular-images/input

## Object label to be detected and classified

1. Glaucoma
2. Cataract
3. Normal
4. diabetic_retinopathy

## Documentation:

1. Looking for references dataset
2. labeling each data
3. converts each image to RGB
4. Divide the data in a ratio of 80% (train), 10% (validation) and 10% (test)
5. Augmenting image data and Tuning hyperparameter
6. Conduct machine learning model training experiments with 50,000 to 75,000 train steps
7. Evaluate the machine learning model 
8. Testing real data using another image
11. Save the model by changing t
12. Deploy the model
